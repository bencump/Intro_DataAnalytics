If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.

If the proportion of simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic is sufficiently small (less than or equal to 0.05), then this is evidence against Emily's model.

TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!"
